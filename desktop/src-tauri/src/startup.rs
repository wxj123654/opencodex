//! The startup sequence, as named states inside a window the user can already see.
//!
//! Everything below used to run inside `setup()` before any window existed, and the window was
//! then created hidden. That ordering is why a failed start had no surface: the spawn event stream
//! was discarded, so the child's exit code was gone, and a run of probes that time out rather than
//! refuse takes over a minute with nothing on screen to explain it. D7 inverts it. The window is
//! created and shown first, and the sequence runs inside it as named states under one overall
//! deadline, with a retry, the child's exit code and a diagnostic the user can copy.
//!
//! Registration comes first, before the runtime is touched at all. The order looks backwards until
//! you follow the failing case: a login launch starts hidden, and if the tray were installed only
//! after a successful start then a start that failed would leave a running process with no window
//! and no icon — invisible. The app establishes its own surface, then deals with the runtime.
//!
//! A launch that came from login autostart starts hidden, and that is the only difference — except
//! where there is no usable tray to hide into, which is R1 and lives in [`shows_window`].
